# Main coding branch (since it has issues)

## TO RUN:
PLEASE install and run RSA in python. As its a single library there shouldn't be any errors installing globally, only warnings. However, if you'd like your glboal env to not be messed with please make a venv first. The command to run is:
> python -m pip install rsa

**Note** The Private key is NEEDED to be added to `/code/key/` folder alongisde the public key. The .gitignore has been added with ignoring the private key. Please do not upload the private key to the repo.

* Download ALL code from folder `Code` in repo above

> Open Terminal First, CD into directory where downloaded files are.
* RUN `main.py` with `python3 main.py`
    - Note there should be NOTHING you have to install (other than python itself...)
    - TO STOP server do ctrl+c on keyboard on terminal where server is running.
    
> Open another terminal in directory where downloaded files are first then:
* RUN `tk_client.py` with `python3 tk_client.py`
    - TO EXIT just click the X in the GUI.

> Note there may be errors, if so shoot Jason a msg on teams or make an issue.

## TODO:

- Just so I (Jason) Don't forget: Fix (well not fix but will be good to) add a JSON in between people. What I mean is:

Currently -> WHOLE messages DB is replaced by new version using a lock when anyone sends any message to any user -> but this is innefecient. 

Need something (Maybe make new JSON temp db for a specific chat between users then simply append those chats?), etc.
