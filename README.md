## TODO/Notes:

- Just so I (Jason) Don't forget: Fix (well not fix but will be good to) add a JSON in between people. What I mean is:

Currently -> WHOLE messages DB is replaced by new version using a lock when anyone sends any message to any user -> but this is innefecient. 

Need something (Maybe make new JSON temp db for a specific chat between users then simply append those chats?), etc.
